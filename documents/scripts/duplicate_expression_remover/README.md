The code in [wt_stemtest.py](https://github.com/dondi/GRNsight-archive/blob/main/documents/scripts/duplicate_expression_remover/wt_stemtest.py) removes duplicates from a file and writes it into same/new file per decision of user. The file with the duplicates needs to be read by providing the address to the duplicate file, then the code is executed and the data with no duplicates needs to be saved to a file (either overwrite the same file or a new file) decided by user.
